Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We
release regularly. Here are the release notes from version 186.

### Services: Redesign Services page

During usability testing, we discovered the Service Details page was hard to
understand for administrators with a non-Linux background. The page now
uses neutral, well-known terminology. Additionally, action buttons are now next to service status.

### Responsive System Overview page

The overview page layout has been improved and includes fixes for mobile
devices. This is part of an ongoing process to improve layout across all of
Cockpit.
