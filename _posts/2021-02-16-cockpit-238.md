Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).  We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit version 238.

### Updates: List outdated software that needs a restart

Previously, we required a system reboot after every update. We now use [Tracer](http://tracer-package.com/)
to display the list of services and applications that are outdated and need to be restarted or require a system reboot.

If there are not such services not system reboot will be suggested.

If there are such services, the user will be asked to either to restart these or schedule a system reboot.

### Web server: Preserve permissions of administrator-provided certificates

Cockpit's web server supports and encourages [using your own TLS certificate/key](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/https.html#https-certificates) in `/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/`.
Previously, starting cockpit would adjust the file permissions and SELinux context of administrator provided
certificates.  But commonly such files are shared with other services, in which case the permission changes could render
the file inaccessible for these other services.

Now cockpit only adjusts the permissions of certificate files which it creates and manages itself, in particular
`0-self-signed.cert` and `10-ipa.cert`. If you provide your own certificate, you must make sure yourself that these are
readable by the `cockpit-ws` user or group.

### System: Performance page shows busiest CPU cores

### Machines: VM disk creation supports a custom path

You can now use a custom path when adding disks to a VM. This can be either pointing
to a disk image file or an ISO which will be attached as a CDROM device.
